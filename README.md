# Project Proposal: Advanced Audio Signal Processing and Recognition

## Overview  
This project extends basic laboratory experiments into a full research-oriented system for audio signal processing and recognition. While the initial lab demonstrated preprocessing, feature extraction, and simple classification, this project upgrades the workflow by integrating dataset augmentation, advanced feature representations, and modern machine learning models. The goal is to transform a classroom-level exercise into a scalable project with practical and research value.

## Objectives  
- Develop an **enhanced pipeline** for audio classification that goes beyond traditional lab settings.  
- Integrate **data augmentation and synthesis** to address dataset imbalance and improve robustness.  
- Explore **advanced time-frequency representations**, such as mel-spectrograms and chroma features.  
- Compare **classical machine learning methods** with **deep learning architectures** for classification.  
- Design a **prototype application** capable of performing real-time recognition.

## Proposed Methodology  
1. **Dataset Expansion**  
   - Move beyond three basic categories by including a wider range of instruments or vocal styles.  
   - Implement augmentation techniques such as pitch shifting, time stretching, and additive noise.  

2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Traditional preprocessing (pre-emphasis, framing, windowing).  
   - Advanced features: MFCCs + delta coefficients, spectral centroid, chroma, spectral contrast.  
   - Time-frequency visualization: mel-spectrograms and constant-Q transform (CQT).  

3. **Modeling Approaches**  
   - **Classical Models**: SVM, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting.  
   - **Deep Learning**:  
     - 1D CNNs on raw waveforms.  
     - 2D CNNs (ResNet, VGG-like) on spectrograms.  
     - Hybrid CRNN models for sequential learning.  

4. **FM Synthesis & Generative Methods**  
   - Extend FM synthesis into a controlled **data generation tool**.  
   - Investigate using generative models (e.g., GANs or VAEs) to create synthetic training samples.  

5. **Evaluation & Deployment**  
   - Perform cross-validation and confusion matrix analysis.  
   - Compare classical vs deep models in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computation cost.  
   - Build a lightweight **real-time recognition demo** with MATLAB App Designer or Python (PyQT/Streamlit).

## Expected Outcomes  
- A reproducible project that highlights how **core signal processing** integrates with **modern machine learning**.  
- Improved recognition accuracy compared to baseline lab results, especially under noisy or augmented conditions.  
- Visualization of feature spaces and decision boundaries that provide insight into model behavior.  
- A deployable prototype demonstrating real-time audio recognition.  

---

## Future Work  
- Extend from **instrument recognition** to **speech emotion recognition** or **speaker identification**.  
- Explore transfer learning with pre-trained audio models (e.g., YAMNet, OpenL3).  
- Investigate interpretability techniques to explain which frequency regions influence model predictions.  
- Deploy optimized models on **edge devices** for low-latency applications.

## Impact  
This upgraded project serves as a bridge between **theory and application**. It not only consolidates knowledge of signal processing fundamentals but also demonstrates how advanced techniques and models can be used in modern music information retrieval, speech technology, and real-time interactive systems.
